# Gemini CLI Rules

## Core Instructions

- **Always read `planning.md` at the start of every new conversation.** This will ensure you have the latest information about the project's architecture, tech stack, and overall vision.
- **Check `tasks.md` before starting your work.** This file contains the list of tasks to be done. You should always know what the next task is.
- **Mark completed tasks immediately.** When you finish a task, mark it as done in `tasks.md` with the completion date.
- **Add any new tasks that you discover.** If you find new tasks during our conversation, add them to `tasks.md`.
- **At the end of each session, add a session summary to this file.** This will help us keep track of the progress made in each session.

## Session Summaries
